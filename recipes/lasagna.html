<h2>Description</h2>
 <p>It was very good and is great for leftovers too. I did make a key change: I used a homemade sauce instead of a jarred sauce. The homemade sauce already had onion and garlic so I left those out of the main recipe. I enjoyed the cheddar cheese in this recipe my mother had always used only mozzarella. I recommend this recipe and I look forward to having it again (with my own sauce recipe). Oh yah add some shredded parmessan after you take it from the oven!
